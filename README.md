This repository contains the data and code to reproduce Predicting the _In-Between: Present and Future Habitat Suitability of an Intertidal Euryhaline Fish_. The data is packaged in a **.RData** file stored using the LFS. The data file contains all environmental data, occurrence data, and outputs relative to the project. The **R markdown file** contains all the code and is annotated. We annotated the R markdown file by line to describe each command and by chunk to provide context for the analysis. All files are stored in the **master** branch.
